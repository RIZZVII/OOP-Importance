Importance of OOP and why it is necessaryin C++
Imagine you're playing with a set of building blocks. Each block is like an object, and you can use them to build all sorts of cool stuff.

1. **Objects**: Every block is different, right? Some are red, some are blue, and they all have their own shapes and sizes. Well, in programming, objects are like those blocks. They're individual things that have their own unique qualities and abilities.

2. **Classes: Now, imagine you have a special box with instructions on how to build different types of things with your blocks - like a car, a house, or a treehouse. Those instructions are like classes in programming. They tell you what kind of blocks you need and how to put them together to make a specific thing.

3. **Encapsulation**: Let's say you're building a treehouse. You don't need to know how every single block works inside the car or the house. You just need to know how to use them to build your treehouse. That's encapsulation - keeping the details of how things work hidden away so you can focus on what you're building.

4. **Inheritance**: Now, imagine you have a set of instructions for building a basic house. If you want to build a fancier house, you can start with those basic instructions and add extra details, like a swimming pool or a balcony. That's inheritance - starting with something basic and building on top of it to make something more specialized.

5. **Polymorphism**: This one's a bit like having different types of blocks that all fit into the same slot. Let's say you have a slot for a round block. You can put in a small round block, a big round block, or even a round block with spikes - they all fit because they're all round. In programming, you can do similar things with different types of objects that share common traits.

So, Object-Oriented Programming is basically like playing with building blocks, but with code. It helps keep things organized and makes it easier to create and work with different parts of a program.
